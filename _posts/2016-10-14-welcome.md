This is tutorial project for building a 3D planet animation in HTML5, JavaScript and the WebGL API

![Sora](images/sora.jpg)

## About
_Sora_ is a tutorial designed to take familiarity with a broad range of technologies:

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- WebGL API

The purpose of it is to get familiar with JavaScript from the very early learning stages and realizing how many cool things can be done with few lines of code and a superficial understanding of the WebGL API.

## What will we do?
In this tutorial, we are going to create a 3D scene with a star background and a planet in the center. We are going to model Earth and its atmosphere, an animation will also be added to make the planet rotate.

## Who is this for?
This tutorial has been designed for very beginners. A very basic knowledge of Javascript is required, however it can be included as part of the experience.
