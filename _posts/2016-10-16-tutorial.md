# Building a 3D Earth and Moon animation
In this tutorial you will learn how to use [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), the [WebGL API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) and the [THREE library](https://threejs.org/) to create a 3D animation in your browser.

## Requirements
For this tutorial you are going to need:

1. An internet browser. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) is recommended because it has an easy way to disable [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) and a tutorial is provided here for that.
2. A text editor. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is recommended because it has very good code highlight features and can be installed on all systems.

## First steps
Creating a 3D animation using Javascript and the WebGL API requires some code. In particular there is a lot of code for setting the basic stuff needed for whatever 3D project, namely a scene, a camera and some lights. Setting all these initial things together takes a lot of time and the WebGL API are very low level (every single point in a mesh is to be defined and a lot of matrix calculus is involved).

**THREE.js to the rescue** For this reason, we use a high level library called [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) which hides all the mathematics behind objects and animations and lets us focus on the cool things. Thanks to this library, we are going to write much shorter code, making it easy to create objects and animate them.

**Preset pieces** Another detail to be aware of is that we are going to use a few snippets of code already prepared for you for some functionalities we are going to need. We could go though this code and build it together, but that would require some more time spent on a few minor things we don't want to focus on in the context of this tutorial. So we are just going to import and use it and that's all!

This tutorial also comes with some images we are going to use as well. They are going to be required once we start defining the material of the objects we'll create later.

## Defining the project structure
We start by creating the project structure with the folders and files we are going to need.

1. In your system, locate a place where you want to create the project. Usually your user's home folder in Linux and iOS, or the `Documents` folder in Windows are good choices.
2. Create a folder called `sora`.
3. Inside that folder create the following folder directory and also create the files indicated below.

Some code that is going to work hopefully
