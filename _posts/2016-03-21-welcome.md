This is tutorial project for building a universal web app with Visual Studio 2015 and Cordova

![Calcifer](images/calcifer.png)

## About
_Calcifer_ is a tutorial designed to take familiarity with a broad range of technologies:

- Web apps
- Visual Studio 2015
- Cordova
- HTML5, Javascript, CSS

The purpose of it is not getting deep understanding of those technologies, but rather provide a generic overview of what they are and how they can empower a developer to build cool apps for all the stores.

## What will we do?
We are going to build a cross-platform app (an app which is developed in HTML, Javascript and CSS which can be run on Windows phone, Android and iOS).

The app will display a [Bing Map](http://www.microsoft.com/maps/choose-your-bing-maps-API.aspx) and the user will be able to display his current position on it!

## Who is this for?
This tutorial has been designed for very beginners. A very basic knowledge of Javascript is required, however it can be included as part of the experience.
