# Building a cross-platform app
A tutorial project for building a universal web app with Visual Studio 2015 and Cordova

## Requirements
For this tutorial you are going to need:

1. [Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx)
2. A Windows Phone, or an Android phone

**Important:** Installation is not covered by this tutorial.

## Initial setup and project configuration
We start by creating a new _Cordova project_ in Visual Studio.

![New project on Visual Studio](images/vsnewproject.png)

We can skip creating a folder for solution. So we now have a solution that we can use to build our app using HTML5, Javascript and CSS.

### Installing Cordova's Geolocation plug-in
The next step is installing the [Geolocation plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation) in our project. That is necessary because we want to use device's location API in order to get the position and show it on the map.

1. In your project, open file `config.xml`.
2. Select _Plugins_ in the left-most pane.
3. Selct _Core_ in the next pane's top area.
4. Select _Geolocation_ in the list of plugins.
5. Click on _Add_.

![Cordova Geolocation plugin](images/geolocation.png)

The process might take a while. After that the plugin should be marked as installed in the list.

## Setting pages and layouts
We now move forward to creating some layout structures. I this process our goal is to create the elements of the UI (User Interface) of our app.

1. In the _Solution Explorer_ pane, open file `index.html` under folder `www`.

When the file opens, you get access to the HTML code. This is our page, the entry point of our app. Once the user starts the app, he will see this. 

How does the app look like at the moment? It is easy to see! Since we are basically developing a web application, just do the following:

1. Right click on the page tab in Visual Studio.
2. Select _Open Containing Folder_.
3. The directory containing `index.html` is displayed.
4. Double click on `index.html` and open it with your favorite browser.
5. Resize the browser window in order to resemble the size of a phone in portrait mode.

This is how the app looks like at the moment! There is just a text prefilled by Visual Studio as an initial content. 

### Designing the page structure
Let's add some parts to our page. We want the interface to look like the following:

![Wireframes for our app](images/wireframes.png)

The diagram above is a schematic representation of how our app will be. Of course it will not look like exactly like that. We will make it way cooler, but the picture shows us the components we want:

- A top bar to place the title of our app.
- A title element.
- A button element the user can use to request his location.
- An information panel to display some informational text.
- A panel hosting our map.

What we;ve done so far is called _Designing_. Design happens before starting writing code and it is very important. It is the time where we set our objectives and draw the app to understand what we want it to look like.

### Defining components in our app
We can now start coding! The first thing we do is setting the title of our page. 

1. Locate, in `index.html`, the `<title>` tag which resides into the `<head>` element. This tag contains a text which we want change. 
2. Type in the tag the name of your app.

The tag should look like this:

{% highlight html %}
<title>calcifer (Tutorial)</title>
{% endhighlight %}

This title **will NOT be displayed**! Remember that everything that gets displayed reside into the `<body>` tag! In the `<head>` tag we have the settings of our app!

#### Creating the main parts
Now we can move to the content of our app!

1. Locate tag `<body>`.
2. Append on top the `<div>` element for the top bar: `<div class="bar"></div>`.
3. Add another tag for message panel: `<div class="top"></div>`.
4. Add the tag for hosting the map: `<div id="mapDiv" class="map-host"></div>`.

#### Focusing on the top bar

1. In the first `div` we've added, add a tag for the title: `<span class="title">Calcifer</span>`.
2. Now add another `<span>` for the button: `<span id="mylocationButton" class="mylocation">My Location</span>`.

The top bar should look like this:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<div class="bar">
    <span class="title">Calcifer</span>
    <span id="mylocationButton" class="mylocation">My Location</span>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

#### Focusing on the message panel

1. In the second `div` we created, add a `<span>` for the message panel: `<span id="message" class="info">Hello! I am ready!</span>`.

The message bar tag should  look like this:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<div class="top">
    <span id="message" class="info">Hello! I am ready!</span>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

We have added `"Hello! I am ready!"` as the initial content to display.

#### Finalizing

The `<body>` should now look like this:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<body>
    <div class="bar">
        <span class="title">Calcifer</span>
        <span class="titlemini">Ca</span>
        <span id="mylocationButton" class="mylocation">My Location</span>
    </div>

    <div class="top">
        <span id="message" class="info">Hello! I am ready!</span>
    </div>

    <div id="mapDiv" class="map-host"></div>
    ...
</body>
{% endhighlight %}

The 3 elements we have introduced are what we need. If you refresh `index.html` in your browser, you will see that the page looks terrible! That's because we need to add styles. But that is not something HTML is responsible for, we need CSS!

### Styling page parts
Let's create a new file called `style.css` into `www/css`.

1. Right click on the `css` folder in the _Solution Explorer_ and select _Add_ and then _New Item..._.
2. Select _Style Sheet_ as file type and name it: `index.css`.

`index.css` is the strylesheet for our app. But we need to include it in `index.hmtl` otherwise the style we will code will not be applied to the page. So open `index.html` and locate the title the `<head>` section:

{% highlight html %}
<title>calcifer (Tutorial)</title>
{% endhighlight %}

Just below it add the following line of markup:

{% highlight html %}
<link href="css/index.css" rel="stylesheet" />
{% endhighlight %}
    
The line before tells the browser that pur page needs a style and that style is located at the specified path in attribute `href`.

#### Defining styles
Let's get back to `index.css` and add some selectors ad styling rules. With CSS you can specify which HTML tags you want a style to be applied to. These are called _selectors_. Inside a selector we write rules which will specify how an HTML element will look like.

The first thing we do, is defining styles for the elements we have defined in `index.html` by creating a correspondance with attribute `class` in every tag:

{% highlight css linenos %}
body {}

.bar {}
.top {}
.map-host {}
.title {}
.mylocation {}
.mylocation {}
.info {}
{% endhighlight %}

Inside those selectors we are going to insert styling rules in order to make our app look better. The first style we apply is to the bosy of the page in order to remove any spacing between the page borders and the content we are going to create. We do this by removing padding and margin:

{% highlight css linenos %}
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### The top bar
Let's focus on the top bar and let's make it look dark grey. We also want it to be on the top of the page and occupy the whole width of the screen.

{% highlight css linenos %}
.bar {
  background-color: #464646;    /* A dark grey */
  position: absolute;           /* Position from the page's top-left corner */
  top: 0;                       /* Position it right on top */
  width: 100%;                  /* Occupy all page's width */
  height: 50px;                 /* We want the bar to be 50 pixel tall */
}
{% endhighlight %}

The text between `/*` and `*/` are comments which you can avoid typing! Try to refresh `index.html` and you will see the grey bar on top.

#### The info panel
The info panel is the next element we focus on. The panel should:

- Appear right below the top bar.
- Take all page's width like the top bar.
- Be yellow and transparent so that the map, which will show below, can be seen through.

In CSS it means the following:

{% highlight css linenos %}
.top {
  position: absolute;                         /* Position from the page's top-left corner */
  top: 50px;                                  /* Below the top bar, shoft down by the top bar's height */
  width: 100%;                                /* Take all width */
  background-color: rgba(255, 185, 0, 0.85);  /* Yellow + 85% transparent */
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### The map host
We now move to the last component: the one which will host the map. Those are the specifications:

- We want the map to take all the app's size.

Not much of a requirement after all, it is actually very easy to translate this into CSS:

{% highlight css linenos %}
.map-host {
  position: absolute;         /* Position from the page's top-left corner */
  top: 0;                     /* Position it right on top */
  width: 100%;                /* Occupy all page's width */
  height: 100%;               /* Occupy all page's height */
  background-color: #efefef;  /* Just a random light color to see the element */
}
{% endhighlight %}

As you noticed we also have applied a background color. That is why we want to see the map host. This is just for testing. The point is that, if we do not apply a color, we will never get a general idea of how the app will look like. That happens because we still need to load the Bing map, but this is something we'll do later. For now we want to concentrate on styling our app, thus we use a color for the map host to see what we will get once the map will be loaded there.

### From the first iteration to the second
How does it look like now? Try refreshing `index.html`! It is a mess! Yes because we need to tune a little bit more our styling.

The real problem is that we need to tell the browser that the 3 parts we have defined should appear one on top of each other. In particular we need the following:

1. The map should be shown first.
2. The top bar should be shown on top of the map.
3. The info panel should be shown also on top of the map.

Note that the top bar and the info panel do not overlap each other because we specified, on the info panel, an absolute vertical cooridnate of 50 pixels: `top: 50px`, which is exactly the height of the top bar. We can specify a depth order by means of CSS rule `z-order`:

{% highlight css linenos %}
.bar {
  ...
  z-index: 2;
}
.top {
  ...
  z-index: 2;
}
.map-host {
  ...
  z-index: 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The map host will be the lowest layer, while the info panel and the top bar will be sitting on top on the same layer.

Let's refresh now. Well it looks a bit better and the parts are getting their correct positions in the general layout.

## Adding the map
The layout is basically done in its most foundamental parts. Now we want to add the map. This tutorial will not focus on how to get the key required for using the Bing Maps API. So I am assuming you already have activated your Live account to use Bing Maps and that you have succeeded into getting a development key.

The key you get is an alphanumeric string, below is an example of how it can look like:

{% highlight javascript %}
ArzkZ2pZslqT62hiKsqZ51c7qRjySokqJAUOG084nrZHSHXBESaOpN9631-9j6lo
{% endhighlight %}

**Important!** The key is secret, so do not share it or expose it!

### Creating the map handling file
We need to create a Javascript file that will contain all the code to create the map and work with it.

1. Right click on the `scripts` folder in the _Solution Explorer_ and select _Add_ and then _New Item..._.
2. Select _JavaScript File_ as file type and name it: `map.js`.

Before writing all the logic we need, let us forst include this file into our page.

1. Go back to `index.html`.
2. Locate the `<body>` element and locate the closing tag: `</body>`.
3. Just before the closing tag `</body>`, add the following line of code:

{% highlight html %}
<script src="scripts/map.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
    
Your `<body>` should look like the following:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<body>
    <div class="bar">
        <span class="title">Calcifer</span>
        <span id="mylocationButton" class="mylocation">My Location</span>
    </div>
    <div class="top">
        <span id="message" class="info">Hello! I am ready!</span>
    </div>
    <div id="mapDiv" class="map-host"></div>

    <script src="cordova.js"></script>
    <script src="scripts/platformOverrides.js"></script>
    <script src="scripts/index.js"></script>
    <script src="scripts/map.js"></script>
</body>
{% endhighlight %}

Save everything and go back to `map.js`.

### Showing the map
Now we are ready to create the Bing map. In `map.js` write the following:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
(function () {
  "use strict";

  var initializeMap = function() {
    map = new Microsoft.Maps.Map(
      document.getElementById('mapDiv'),
      {
        credentials: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx",    /* Replace this string with your Bing maps key here */
        center: new Microsoft.Maps.Location(45.5, -122.5),    /* Redmond! */
        mapTypeId: Microsoft.Maps.MapTypeId.road,             /* Display roads */
        zoom: 7,                                              /* Zoom level: town */
        showScalebar: false,                                  /* Do not show controls */
        showMapTypeSelector: false,                           /* Do not show selectors */
        showDashboard: false,                                 /* Do not show the dashboard */
        enableSearchLogo : false                              /* Do not show the search bar */
      }
    );
  };
  
  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    initializeMap();
  }, false);
})();
{% endhighlight %}

This piece of code creates a structure which calls function `initializeMap` as soon as the page has loaded and we get access to its elements.

We do not need anything more. Try refreshing `index.html` after saving everything and you should see the map underneath the top bar and the info panel.

## More styling
We want to make the app look better. In fact, we need to style the title inside the top bar and the text inside the info panel. To do that, we add the following selectors in `index.css`:

{% highlight css linenos %}
.title {}
.mylocation {}
.info {}
{% endhighlight %}

Again, let's focus on each one of them at a time.

### The title
Styling the title will require us to meet some requirements as we want the title to:

- Be aligned to the left and be placed at the (vertical) middle of the bar.
- Have a nice font.
- Have white text.

Meeting the alignment will require us to use a special CSS feature called [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). We will not enter in details about Flexbox here, so if you want to know more, just follow the link!

Flexbox gets pretty handy when we want to align elements. The first thing we need to do, is telling the container to enable Flex. So locate CSS selector `.bar` that we wrote before and add the following rule:

{% highlight css linenos %}
.bar {
  ...
  display: flex;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we need to set some Flex rules to the element in the container; thus add the following rules to `.title`:

{% highlight css linenos %}
.title {
  flex: 1 1 auto;       /* Allow the element to grow or shrink */
  align-self: center;   /* Align the element to vertical middle */
  color: #ffffff;       /* Text will be white */
  padding-left: 7px;    /* Add some space on the left */
}
{% endhighlight %}

We also added `padding-left` to have some space between the text and the left border, otherwise it would look bad.

#### Applying a better font
If you try to refresh `index.html`, you will see the changes. however the title still looks bad. We would like to change the font! Well, in the old days this was a very bad limit as web developers had to rely on the fonts installed on the user's computer; and of course no guarantees that font would have been there. A common set of well known fonts were used, but those fonts were very ugly and left not much to fantasy. Today we have font repositories in the Cloud hosted on many services. Like this, we do not have to worry about font availability anymore, as we will take fonts directly from the Internet, if the user has not those fonts installed, it is not a problem.

One of those [Web Font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_typography) services is hosted by [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/): [Adobe Web Fonts](https://edgewebfonts.adobe.com/). I will not enter in details about how to use the service. We will download 3 fonts from the Adobe repository:

- Adobe [Source Sans Pro](https://edgewebfonts.adobe.com/fonts#/?collection=source-sans-pro)
- Adobe [Patua One](https://edgewebfonts.adobe.com/fonts#/?collection=patua-one)
- Adobe [Istok Web](https://edgewebfonts.adobe.com/fonts#/?collection=istok-web)

We can reference these fonts by adding the following piece of code in `index.html` just in the `<head>` section (as the last line before closing tag `</head>`):

{% highlight javascript %}
<script src="http://use.edgefonts.net/source-sans-pro:n2,i2,n3,i3,n4,i4,n6,i6,n7,i7,n9,i9;patua-one;istok-web.js"></script>
}
{% endhighlight %}

Since we have included the fonts, we can now use them in `index.css` and complete the styling for title:

{% highlight css linenos %}
.title {
  ...
  font-family: patua-one, serif;  /* Use Adobe Patua One font */
  font-size: 23pt;                /* Set size to 23 points */
}
{% endhighlight %}

Try refreshing `index.html` and you will see our brand new title with nice font in the top bar.

**Important!** We included two more fonts that we will use later in this tutorial.

### The get-my-location button
We now want to style element `<span id="mylocationButton" class="mylocation">My Location</span>`. This will be a button which the user can press. When the button is pressed, we will update the location on the map. Our button should have the following specifications:

- Should be aligned to the right in the top bar and be placed at the middle of the bar.
- Should be white with transparent background and white border.
- When the mouse hovers on it, the pointer (hand, the icon that usually shows up when hovering on a link) icon should be shown.

We can achieve this by means of the following rules:

{% highlight css linenos %}
.mylocation {
  font-family: source-sans-pro, sans-serif;  /* Using Adobe Source Sans Pro font */
  font-size: 11pt;                /* Font size to 11 points */
  border: 1px solid #ffffff;      /* Applying a 1 pixel white border */
  color: #ffffff;                 /* Setting color to white for the text */
  margin-right: 12px;             /* Adding some space between the button and the right margin */
  align-self: center;             /* Aligning to vertical middle */
  padding: 4px 7px 4px 7px;       /* Defining inner spacing */
  cursor: pointer;                /* Using the pointer cursor */
  flex: 0 0 auto;                 /* Does not allow the element to shrink or grow */
  -webkit-touch-callout: none;
  -webkit-user-select: none;
  -moz-user-select: none;
  -ms-user-select: none;
  user-select: none;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The last 5 rules are all for the same reason: not allowing text to be selected as this is a button! This feature is still not fully supported in CSS, thus browsers prefix the rule with a special name specific for each browser. In order to ensure that all browsers apply this rule, we must include all prefixes. If a browser does not recognize a rule, it will not return an error, but will simply ignore the rule!

Please note that we used a little trick here with flex to have the button be aligned to the right: `flex: 0 0 auto`. Since the title is allowed to grow, it will take all the space, while leaving our button only with the remaining one. Like this we make sure that the button is always on the right! You can check in developers tools in your browser:

![CSS trick to align the button to the right](images/flex.png)

Try refreshing the page. You should now see the button with a much better styling!

### The info text
The text in the info panel will be placed inside element `<span id="message" class="info">...</span>` whose class is `info`. We want the text to use the last font we included before. Add the following rules in `index.css`:

{% highlight css linenos %}
.info {
  font-family: istok-web, sans-serif;  /* Use Adobe Istok Web font */
  color: #464646;                      /* Text color should be grey */
  font-size: 15pt;                     /* Text size to 15 points */
  padding: 10px;                       /* Set 10 pixel space around the text */
}
{% endhighlight %}

Refresh the page and see the changes!

![The app how it should look like](images/app.png)

## Adding logic
We now want this app to do something other than just looking good!

Open `map.js` and add these lines of code in addition to those one we already wrote before:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
(function () {
  "use strict";

  var map = null;
  var locationAvailable = false;
  var busy = false;

  var initializeMap = function() {
    ...
  };

  var initializeLocationAvailability = function() {
  };

  var initializeInteractions = function () {
  };
  
  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    initializeMap();
    initializeInteractions();
    initializeLocationAvailability();
  }, false);
})();
{% endhighlight %}
    
There are some pieces missing that we will add now, so do not panic!

Add code to `initializeLocationAvailability`:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var initializeLocationAvailability = function() {
  locationAvailable = window.navigator && window.navigator.geolocation;
};
{% endhighlight %}
    
### Utility functions
Define utility function to clear map:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var clearMap = function () {
  map.entities.clear();
};
{% endhighlight %}

Define utility function for drawing a circle of a certain radius centered in a certain point:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// Radius is expressed in km
var drawCircle = function (radius, latitude, longitude) {
  var backgroundColor = new Microsoft.Maps.Color(10, 100, 0, 0);
  var borderColor = new Microsoft.Maps.Color(150, 200, 0, 0);

  var R = 6371; // Earth's mean radius in km
  var lat = (latitude * Math.PI) / 180;
  var lon = (longitude * Math.PI) / 180;
  var d = parseFloat(radius) / R;
  var circlePoints = new Array();

  for (var x = 0; x <= 360; x += 5) {
    var p2 = new Microsoft.Maps.Location(0, 0);
    var brng = x * Math.PI / 180;
    p2.latitude = Math.asin(Math.sin(lat) * Math.cos(d) + Math.cos(lat) * Math.sin(d) * Math.cos(brng));

    p2.longitude = ((lon + Math.atan2(Math.sin(brng) * Math.sin(d) * Math.cos(lat),
                      Math.cos(d) - Math.sin(lat) * Math.sin(p2.latitude))) * 180) / Math.PI;
    p2.latitude = (p2.latitude * 180) / Math.PI;
    circlePoints.push(p2);
  }

  var polygon = new Microsoft.Maps.Polygon(circlePoints, { fillColor: backgroundColor, strokeColor: borderColor, strokeThickness: 1 });

  map.entities.push(polygon);
};
{% endhighlight %}

Define utility function for drawing pin:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// Accuracy is expressed in meters
var drawPin = function (latitude, longitude, accuracy) {
  var point = new Microsoft.Maps.Location(latitude, longitude);
  var pin = new Microsoft.Maps.Pushpin(point, { typeName: 'pin' });
  clearMap();
  map.entities.push(pin);

  drawCircle(accuracy / 1000, latitude, longitude);

  map.setView({ zoom: 16, center: point });
};
{% endhighlight %}

Place all these functions in the right place and define function `initializeInteractions`:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
(function () {
  "use strict";

  ...

  var clearMap = function () { ... };
  var drawCircle = function (radius, latitude, longitude) { ... };
  var drawPin = function (latitude, longitude, accuracy) { ... };

  var initializeMap = function() {
      ...
  };
  var initializeLocationAvailability = function() {
      ...
  };
  var initializeInteractions = function () {};

  ...
})();
{% endhighlight %}

### The main logic
We now define the main logic. We follow two algorithms using the asynchronous mechanism.

#### Requesting location
To request location we act as follows:

![Requesting location](images/map1.png)

#### Handling location
Once we have the location, we can proceed as specifid below.

![Getting location](images/map2.png)

#### The code
The final code is:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var initializeInteractions = function () {
  var button = document.getElementById('mylocationButton');
  button.addEventListener('click', function () {
    var message = document.getElementById('message');

    // Are we busy?
    if (busy) {
      message.textContent = 'Still working on it! Be patient...';
      return;
    }

    // If location is not available, display error message
    if (!locationAvailable) {
      message.textContent = 'Location not available on this device!';
      return;
    }

    // Displaying waiting message
    message.textContent = 'Working on it...';
    // From now on we are busy
